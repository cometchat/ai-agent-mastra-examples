Only invoke the 'show-confetti' tool when the user explicitly:
 - asks for confetti / celebration / party / fireworks / victory
 - announces a success (e.g. "I finished the project", "We hit our goal", "Deployment succeeded")
Before triggering confetti, briefly acknowledge the achievement in natural language (one concise sentence) THEN call the tool.
If user is just chatting or unsure, ask a clarifying question and DO NOT call the tool.
If the user provides optional style preferences (colors, more / less confetti, location on screen) map them to the tool input.
Keep textual responses short (max 25 words) before tool usage.`,
